### What is Haskell?

Haskell is a **purely functional programming language** with **strong static typing** and **lazy evaluation**. It was designed for mathematical correctness, safety, and expressiveness. Unlike imperative languages (such as Python or Java), Haskell treats functions as first-class citizens and emphasizes **immutability** and **pure functions** (functions that do not have side effects).  

It is widely used in academia, research, and some industries where high reliability and correctness are required.

### **Use Cases of Haskell**
Haskell is used in various domains, including:
1. **Finance & Banking** â€“ Used by companies like **Standard Chartered** for risk assessment.
2. **Compilers & Interpreters** â€“ GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) itself is written in Haskell.
3. **Blockchain Development** â€“ **Cardano** blockchain is implemented in Haskell.
4. **Web Development** â€“ Frameworks like **Yesod** allow Haskell to be used for building web applications.
5. **Artificial Intelligence** â€“ Its strong type system helps in writing reliable AI models.
6. **Embedded Systems & Security** â€“ Used in high-assurance systems where correctness is crucial.

## **Understanding the Given Haskell Program**
```haskell
main :: IO()
main = do
    putStrLn "Hello, World!"
```
### **Breakdown of the Code**
1. **`main :: IO()`**  
   - This declares `main` as an **I/O action** (side-effect-producing operation).  
   - In Haskell, `IO ()` represents an action that performs **input/output** and returns a result of type `()` (unit type, meaning no meaningful value is returned).  

2. **`main = do`**  
   - The `do` block is used to sequence multiple I/O actions.  
   - In this case, we have only one action: `putStrLn "Hello, World!"`.  

3. **`putStrLn "Hello, World!"`**  
   - `putStrLn` is an **I/O function** that takes a string and prints it to the console, followed by a newline.  
   - The program outputs:  
     ```
     Hello, World!
     ```

### **Execution Flow**
1. The Haskell runtime system starts execution from `main`.
2. The `putStrLn` function is executed, printing `"Hello, World!"` to the console.
3. The program terminates.

This is the simplest possible **Haskell program** that performs an I/O operation. ðŸš€
