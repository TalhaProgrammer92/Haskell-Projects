This is my first project of a *simple calculator* in Haskell. After learning fundamentals of Haskell, I'm very excited to work on this project. Here's an overview of my calculator
s functionality.

## 1. Integer Only
It only support integer numbers. So, other datatypes are unsupported.

## 2. Two numbers
It only support two numbers as input. More/less are not allowed.

## 3. Solution at once
After taking numbers from user it generate solution of every common arithematic problem like addition, subtraction, etc.

## 4. Run Again and again
It runs again and again untill user enter invalid input.
